# 5-text_indentation.txt

Usage of 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation(text)``.

Text is printed with two lines after each of these characters ``.``, ``?``,
and ``:``.

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hello there.")
    Hello there.
    <BLANKLINE>

There should be no space printed at the beginning and at the end of a line.

    >>> text_indentation("   How are you?")
    How are you?
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> text_indentation("How are you?   ")
    How are you?
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> text_indentation("    Excuse me.    Are you okay?   ")
    Excuse me.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Are you okay?
    <BLANKLINE>


New line escape characters are treated as new line within the string.

    >>> text_indentation("A new \n line.")
    A new 
    line.
    <BLANKLINE>


Invalid Text
============

The ``text`` parameter must be a string and should be within quotation marks
else, a TypeError is raised.

    >>> text_indentation(4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

    >>> text_indentation({"Segun": 24, "Bola": 14})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
